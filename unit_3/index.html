				<h4>Day Care</h4> 
					<p>Your dog will be cared for in our own home alongside our own dogs- we do not use Kennels, and your dog will spend his or her time as part of the family for the duration of their stay</p>
				</section>
				<section class="exercise">
				<h4>We exercise our dogs and yours</h4>	
					<p>Our main walking areas are the Woods, the Common and the fields near Woking, but we like to visit other places too like: Carne Beach, Pendower Beach always under control, and working on long leads until we feel confident to run the dogs free.</p>

					<p>Your dog can also be walked in your home area, if you prefer. Our priority at all times is the safety of your dog and those around us. Your dog will benefit from the basic social training gained by walking together as a pack under our supervision.</p> 

					<p>Your dog will get good exercise mental stimulation and have great fun. We will towel off any wet muddy paws, and offer water at intervals during the walk, and take care to make sure your hound is then well rested.</p>
